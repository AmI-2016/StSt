            <blockquote>
              <p>The aim of the project is to improve the working terminal of the user thanks to devices which
			  correct wrong posture of the body and give the possibility to regulate correctly room’s brightness.</p>
            </blockquote>
            The system is composed by the following parts:
            <ul>
              <li>A wearable device with a set of tilt sensors that give informations about posture.</li>
              <li>A light-sensor that controls the environment brightness and computes some operations
                  to fix it in order to avoid sight tiredness.</li>
              <li>A software used as data control unit of the entire structure.</li>
              <li>A website that shows all the data and suggests user how to improve
                  his working terminal (this function can be realized also by the software).

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Functional Requirements</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><em>Notifications</em> - A vibration warns user to change posture every time
                    it is wrong; a vibrator placed on the “StSt” device must generate the
                    vibration. (1)</li>
                <li><em>Controller</em> - The software must give the possibility to start and stop
                    “StSt” device computation. (1)</li>
                <li><em>Controller</em> - Data are visible in real-time on the software. (2)</li>
                <li><em>Software</em> - The software must have an user interface. (2)</li>
                <li><em>Notifications</em> - Sound signals and displayed messages which suggest user
                    to modify the environment brightness are produced by the software. (2)</li>
                <li><em>Statistics</em> - The software must provide statistics about data received from
                    sensors about shoulders inclination and environment brightness. (3)</li>
                <li><em>Statistics</em> - The website must show a report and a chronology related to
                    all statistics collected during the study session. (3)</li>
                <li><em>Log</em> - The user must be able to log in/out the website (the website must be able to
                    collect and retrieve data from more than one user). (4)

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Non Functional Requirements</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><em>Portability</em> - The system must be compatible with Windows.</li>
                <li><em>Usability</em> - The system supports English language.</li>
                <li><em>Reliability</em> - “StSt” device needs to be connected to PC through USB and so it
                    is necessary that software must run during all session time.</li>
                <li><em>Implementation</em> -“StSt” device must be worn correctly by the user to work in the right way: sensors must
                    be fixed, so it is necessary to implement a close-fitting wearable device.</li>
