<a id="Purpose and Scope" class="anchor" href="#purpose" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Purpose and Scope
</h2>

<p>The aim of the project is to improve the working terminal of the user thanks to devices which correct wrong posture of 
the body and give the possibility to regulate correctly room’s brightness.</p>
<p>The system is composed by the following parts:
<li>A wearable device with a set of tilt sensors that give informations about posture. </li>
<li>A light-sensor that controls the environment brightness and computes some operations to fix it in 
order to avoid sight tiredness.</li> 
<li>A software used as data control unit of the entire structure.</li> 
<li>A website that shows all the data and suggests user how to improve his working terminal (this function can be 
realized also by the software).</li>
</p>
<h2>
  <a id="Definitions" class="anchor" href="#definitions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Definitions
</h2>
<h3>Glossary</h3>
<li>Location: the personal working terminal: at home, in the office or in a room that can be personalized.</li>
<li>Website: Website of “StudyStation”: used to show all the results.</li>
<li>“StSt” device: It is the union of the wearable device and the light sensor.</li>
<li>Wearable device: It is a T-shirt worn by the user during the study session; the tilt sensors and the vibrating 
device are placed on it.</li>
<li>Software: Program that controls all data received to the “StSt” device. It is independent to the website but they 
communicate between each other.</li>
<li>User Interface: Graphic interface of the software that allows user to interact with hardware parts of “StSt” device. </li>
<h3>Actors</h3>
<li>Target user: user who is approaching to study or work on their working terminal using “StudyStation”.</li>
<li>Administrator: user that accesses software or website to execute the following actions: log in, start the study session, close the study session, get results of the data, log out.</li>
<h2>
  <a id="Functional-Requirements" class="anchor" href="#functional" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Functional Requirements
</h2>
LOG
<li>The user must be able to log in/out the website. (4)</li>
STATISTICS
<li>The software must provide statistics about data received from sensors about
shoulders inclination and environment brightness. (2)</li>
<li>The website must show a report and a chronology related to all statistics collected during the study session. (3)</li>
NOTIFICATIONS
<li>
  A vibration warns user to change posture every time it is wrong; a vibrator 
  placed on the “StSt” device must generate the vibration. (1)</li>
<li>
  Sound signals and displayed messages which suggest user to modify the environment brightness are produced by the software. (2)
</li>
CONTROLLER
<li>
  The software must give the possibility to start and stop “StSt” device computation. (1)
</li>
<li>
  Data are visible in real-time on the software. (2)
</li>
SOFTWARE
<li>
  The software must have an user interface. (2)
</li>
<h2>
<a id="Non-Funcitional-Requirements" class="anchor" href="#non-functional" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Non Functional Requirements</h2>
  <li>
    The system must be compatible with Windows. (Area: Portability)
  </li>
  <li>The system supports English language. (Area: Usability)
  </li>
  <li>
    “StSt” device needs to be connected to PC through USB and so it is necessary that software must run 
    during all session time. (Area: Reliability)
  </li>
  <li>
    “StSt” device must be worn correctly by the user to work in the right way: sensors must be fixed, so it is necessary to 
    implement a close-fitting wearable device. (Area: Implementation)
  </li>
