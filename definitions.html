<a id="Purpose and Scope" class="anchor" href="#purpose" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Purpose and Scope</h2>

<p>The aim of the project is to improve the workstation within devices which correct wrong posture of the body when the user is working on his terminal, and they also give the possibility to regulate the correct study room’s brightness.</p>

<p>The system has the following parts: a wearable device (composed by a set of tilt sensors that give informations about posture), a camera (which measures the distance between user and his PC), a light-sensor (that controls the environment brightness and computes some operations to fix it to avoid sight tiredness) and a Software (used as a Control Unit of the entire structure that shows all the data and suggests user to improve his working station through displayed messages). The PC is used to collect and show statistics.  </p>

<h2>
<a id="Definitions" class="anchor" href="#definitions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Definitions</h2>
<h3>Glossary</h3>
<li>Location: home or office</li>
<li>Stimuli: the set of audio/message/vibration signals that are supposed to send data about user’s posture</li>
<h3>Actors</h3>
<li>The project is intended to all users that are approaching to study or work on their own workstation, at home, in office…</li>

<h2>
<a id="Functional-Requirements" class="anchor" href="#functional" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Functional Requirements</h2>
<ol>
<li>
  <p>Log.1 - create an account. Priority: 3</p>
  <p>Creating an Account gives the possibility to the user to see statistics on the web page about the position and suggestions to change his habits in a better way. Account is personal, which means that each account has different data related to the user.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>Log.2 - Synchronization between program and web. Priority: 3
  </p>
  <p>The synchronization starts through a signal (Wi-fi or Bluetooth) sent by the user’s PC. Every time the user logs in the web page, the program used to start the device sends data to the webpage. The device must be recognized by the program when active.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>WEB - Data visualization. Priority: 3
  </p>
  <p>The webpage offers to users to see all the data sent by sensors. The webpage may be composed by graphs (at first the report could be a list of data) which show all the statistics about position and environment illumination since service is started. Data are used also to display advices to improve the workstation.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>NOTIFS - Notifications. Priority: 2
  </p>
  <p>A program on PC will communicate with the device. It offers the possibility to switch on StSt and report in real time every information sent by sensors. The program also communicates with the website and send data to it to build a personal “history” and to show possible improvements.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>ACTING - Interacting with the user and the environment. Priority: 1
  </p>
  <p>A program on PC will communicate with the device. It offers the possibility to switch on StSt and report in real time every information sent by sensors. The program also communicates with the website and send data to it to build a personal “history” and to show possible improvements.
  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>
<a id="Non-Funcitional-Requirements" class="anchor" href="#non-functional" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Non Functional Requirements</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Using Camera. Area: Usability</p>
    The camera is not a functional requirement because not every PCs are equipped by a webcam. The device has to offer the possibility to avoid the camera usage. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environment’s illumination sensing. Area: usability
    </p>
    <p>The possibility to change the illumination conditions is too difficult to implement, because it is necessary to include a controller in a plant that already exists. So the sensing may be limited to send data used to display notifications (messages and acoustic signals) to advise a way to change it manually.
