<a id="Purpose and Scope" class="anchor" href="#purpose" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Purpose and Scope
</h2>

<p>The aim of the project is to improve the working terminal of the user thanks to devices which correct wrong posture of 
the body and give the possibility to regulate correctly room’s brightness.</p>
<p>The system has the following parts:
<li>A wearable device composed by a set of tilt sensors that give informations about posture. </li>
<li>A light-sensor that controls the environment brightness and computes some operations to fix it in 
order to avoid sight tiredness.</li> 
<li>A software used as data control unit of the entire structure.</li> 
<li>A website that shows all the data and suggests user how to improve his working terminal (this function can be 
realized also by the software).</li>
</p>
<h2>
  <a id="Definitions" class="anchor" href="#definitions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Definitions
</h2>
<h3>Glossary</h3>
<li>Location: the personal working terminal: at home, in the office or in a room that can be personalized.</li>
<li>Website: Website of “StudyStation”: used to show all the results.</li>
<li>“StSt” device: It is the union of the wearable device and the light sensor.</li>
<li>Wearable device: It is a T-shirt worn by the user during the study session; the tilt sensors and the vibrating 
device are placed on it.</li>
<li>Software: Program that controls all data received to the “StSt” device. It is independent to the website but they 
communicate between each other.</li>
<li>User Interface: Graphic interface of the software that allows user to interact with hardware parts of “StSt” device. </li>
<h3>Actors</h3>
<li>Target user: user who is approaching to study or work on their working terminal using “StudyStation”.</li>
<li>Administrator: user that accesses software or website to execute the following actions: log in, start the study session, close the study session, get results of the data, log out.</li>
<h2>
  <a id="Functional-Requirements" class="anchor" href="#functional" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Functional Requirements
</h2>
<ol>
<li>
  <p>Log.1 - create an account. Priority: 3</p>
  <p>Creating an Account gives the possibility to the user to see statistics on the web page about the position and suggestions to change his habits in a better way. Account is personal, which means that each account has different data related to the user.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>Log.2 - Synchronization between program and web. Priority: 3
  </p>
  <p>The synchronization starts through a signal (Wi-fi or Bluetooth) sent by the user’s PC. Every time the user logs in the web page, the program used to start the device sends data to the webpage. The device must be recognized by the program when active.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>WEB - Data visualization. Priority: 3
  </p>
  <p>The webpage offers to users to see all the data sent by sensors. The webpage may be composed by graphs (at first the report could be a list of data) which show all the statistics about position and environment illumination since service is started. Data are used also to display advices to improve the workstation.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>NOTIFS - Notifications. Priority: 2
  </p>
  <p>A program on PC will communicate with the device. It offers the possibility to switch on StSt and report in real time every information sent by sensors. The program also communicates with the website and send data to it to build a personal “history” and to show possible improvements.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>ACTING - Interacting with the user and the environment. Priority: 1
  </p>
  <p>A program on PC will communicate with the device. It offers the possibility to switch on StSt and report in real time every information sent by sensors. The program also communicates with the website and send data to it to build a personal “history” and to show possible improvements.
  </p>

<h2>
<a id="Non-Funcitional-Requirements" class="anchor" href="#non-functional" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Non Functional Requirements</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Using Camera. Area: Usability</p>
    The camera is not a functional requirement because not every PCs are equipped by a webcam. The device has to offer the possibility to avoid the camera usage. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environment’s illumination sensing. Area: usability
    </p>
    <p>The possibility to change the illumination conditions is too difficult to implement, because it is necessary to include a controller in a plant that already exists. So the sensing may be limited to send data used to display notifications (messages and acoustic signals) to advise a way to change it manually.
