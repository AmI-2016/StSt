The benefit is to leave the body relaxed even after long periods of sitting. The users interested could be all those people who spend a lot of time sitting. Students are supposed to stay  a lot of time on desks during class lectures; a wrong posture may cause backache and also body injury if maintained over time. Our system may prevent it. People who already have those kind of habits and problems may get a useful help from the use of our device!  \r\n\r\nThe device helps  to prevent and correct the wrong posture through a signal used to warn users  as, for example, a vibration from the device itself or a displayed message on the personal computer and smartphones. Furthermore, it gives some suggestions to modify their own workstation. It collects some statistics through sensors placed on some specific and critic points of the body (for example neck, shoulders, lumbar spine) during the session.\r\n\r\n\r\n##AmI Main Steps\r\nAmI Step | Description\r\n------------ | -------------\r\nSensing | Through some sensors our ambient understand the posture of the user.\r\nReasoning | The calculation of the difference between the actual posture and the correct one.\r\nActing | A signal as a vibration and/or a light advises the user of the wrong posture. \r\nInteracting | First the user may start the analysis whenever it's not active yet. Eventually the user can review the data collected by the ambient during the day, month, year. \r\n\r\n##AmI Features\r\nAmI feature | Description\r\n------------ | -------------\r\nSensitive | The system is able to recognize a wrong posture\r\nResponsive | It's able to alert the user in case of a wrong posture.\r\nAdaptive | The system is able to adapt itself to every kind of body and it will start only when needed.\r\nTransparent | Only when the user need a help the device intervenes. Otherwise neither him neither other people notice it.\r\nUbiquitous | The system is based on a wearable device. you can bring it wherever you need it.\r\nIntelligent | It's able to elaborate data and to understand when alert users.\r\n\r\n##Open Issue\r\n1. There may be some problem with fat pepole. \r\n2. How to understand whether the user is sitting or not.\r\n3. What's the best posture?\r\n4. How to fit the device inside the clothes?\r\n5. We will need some tilt sensors (gyroscopes)",
