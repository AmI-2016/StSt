Eventually the user can review the data collected by the ambient during the day, month, year. \r\n\r\n##AmI Features\r\nAmI feature | Description\r\n------------ | -------------\r\nSensitive | The system is able to recognize a wrong posture\r\nResponsive | It's able to alert the user in case of a wrong posture.\r\nAdaptive | The system is able to adapt itself to every kind of body and it will start only when needed.\r\nTransparent | Only when the user need a help the device intervenes. Otherwise neither him neither other people notice it.\r\nUbiquitous | The system is based on a wearable device. you can bring it wherever you need it.\r\nIntelligent | It's able to elaborate data and to understand when alert users.\r\n\r\n##Open Issue\r\n1. There may be some problem with fat pepole. \r\n2. How to understand whether the user is sitting or not.\r\n3. What's the best posture?\r\n4. How to fit the device inside the clothes?\r\n5. We will need some tilt sensors (gyroscopes)",
